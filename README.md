# Melanoma Detection
> Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Problem Statement
- Build a Convolutional Neural Network based model which can accurately detect Melanoma.
- A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.
- International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) prepared dataset consisting of 2357 images of malignant and benign oncological diseases.
- All images were sorted according to the classification taken with ISIC, and all subsets were divided into the same number of images, with the exception of melanomas and moles, whose images are slightly dominant.
